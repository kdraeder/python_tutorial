Even if I were using bash, is seems that ~/.bash_profile does not add the same path
that the installer does.  It adds anaconda/bin instead of condabin.

But I should follow Kent's instructions about minconda3 first or instead.

Hi Kevin,

Nan was having some issues getting conda working with tcsh 
but she and I spent 15 or 20 minutes on zoom (with her sharing her screen) 
and were able to eventually figure it out. 
I would recommend the following (some of which you may have already done, 
based on your earlier emails):

1. get rid of all previous anaconda and miniconda installations 
   (either with "rm -rf" or, if you want to hold on to them, 
   just move them to a directory that you know is not part of the path)
2. git rid of any conda related blocks of code in .bashrc or .tcshrc
3. from bash, run the miniconda installer: 
   https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html 
   (note where it ends up installing, I think the default is ~/miniconda3/)
4. in tcsh, verify that "conda" is in the path. 
   If it isn't, you may need to manually add the directory you noted in (2) to PATH
5. once conda is in your path in tcsh, run "conda --version". 
   I believe 4.8.5 is the most recent but as long as it's 4.7 or 4.8 you should be good for the next step
6. Try running "conda activate"; if it works, your prompt should now include "(base)" 
   to signify you are in a conda environment. 
   That's awesome, you can jump to step 10! 
   But I suspect it will ask you to run conda init, in which case
7. Run "conda init tcsh", which should modify your .tcshrc file
   -- this step is why I recommend making sure your old installations are all out of your PATH in (1) 
   and cleaning up your rc files in (2): 
   I think Nan was running this command with an old version of conda that didn't support tcsh 
   despite having a fresh install and that was adding bad logic to her .tcshrc file
8. Open a new terminal, or source .tcshrc
9. Try running "conda activate" again. 
   If it fails this time, I think a virtual meeting will be necessary to suss out the problem... 
   but this worked for Nan so I've got my fingers crossed :)
10. If the output of "conda --version" was older than 4.8.5, 
    I'd recommend running "conda update -n base conda" to get the latest version.
11. Also, you might want to add "conda activate" to your .tcshrc file so that your new terminals load with conda already activated

Uninstall anaconda.

Follow Julia Kent's instructions 2020-10-13

In https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
I have to choose a MacOSX installer.
Python 3.8 has 2 choices; bash and pkg.
?  How am I supposed to choose.
   Kent said we'll be using bash, so I'll try that.
It opened XCode (after XCode asked to update)
    because that was the default choice in the "you have chosen to open" window.
Then XCode disappeared while I was writing an email to Kent.
I tried it again; this yielded a window with a bash script in it, file named
Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64-1.sh

It doesn't have executable permission.
The online instructions say to verify it before installing it:
bash-3.2$ shasum -a 256 !$                  
shasum -a 256 Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
9b9a353fadab6aa82ac0337c367c23ef842f97868dcbb2ff25ec3aa463afc871  Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

So what?
I'm supposed to be able to verify it at https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda_hashes.html
but that file name is not in that table.

Ignoring the verification and going to the Next window; it's all Windows.
Try the Next: That's macOS
   The first thing there is Download the Installer.
       but I already did.

Forge ahead
% bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

Miniconda3 will now be installed into this location:
/Users/raeder/miniconda3
No, it put it in ~/Downloads/quit, because I apparently tried to quit
conda before following the instructions to close the window,
but it took that 'command' as a directory name.
I'm having so much fun.
This time I read the prompt and let it build in ~/miniconda3.

I closed the window.
A new window doesn't have conda added to the PATH.
Even when I start a bash shell.
I need to `source ~/.bash_profile`.
? Can I put that in a .login file?

Open source; important to manage my packages
   Frequently (in the course of year)
   I can preserve packages in the state use during development

Today; only python, to minimize package confusion
basic conda and git

later; add 1 by 1

create conda env.
% conda create --name python_env python
to  enter packages I want instllld

Activate the env.
% conda activate python_env
Note prompt; says I'm in that env.

% git init .

Creaete a data folder
% mkdir data; cd data

Download sample data file
% curl -kO https://sundowner.colorado.edu/weather/atoc8/wxobs20170821.txt
% git add wxobs20170821.txt 
% git status

Create a script
% cd ..
% vi mysci.py
% python !$
hello

% vi mysci.py
don't forget to close the file (memory management)

readline; good for seeing the header

% vi second 
uses condensed way of reading the file.

data types
   float, integer, ...
can print the data type
print(type(data))
% python second
<class 'str'>
We'll need to parse the data
into a data dictionary

Put it into git
% git add mysci.py second
% git log
% git log --oneline
90f9038 (HEAD -> master) mysci.py not working yet. second is good
